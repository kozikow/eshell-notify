;;; Commentary:

;; This file hooks into eshell mode to provide system notifications
;; about finished commands that took longer than
;; eshell-notify-minimum-threshold-seconds .
;; I use notify.el to send a system notifcation and buffer name for message
;; body. What I typically do is I have buffer named related to the command it
;; is doing - for example eshell-compilation , eshell-tests or
;; eshell-mapreduce
;;
;; By default notify.el have minimum 5 seconds delay between messages.
;; If you want to disable it (I did) run (setq notify-delay '(0 0 0))
;;; Code:
(require 'eshell)
(require 'notify)
